      "detailedDescription": "QASmartTestLab is a production-ready test automation framework demonstrating best practices in test automation. Built with Java 17+, Selenium 4, and Cucumber (JVM), it provides a clean, maintainable structure for UI, API, and database testing. The framework features runtime configuration for browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge), headless execution, remote Grid/Selenoid support, and comprehensive reporting. Following the Page Object Model pattern with clear separation of concerns, it includes configurable timeouts, parallel execution capabilities, and tag-based test filtering for flexible test management.",
      "challenge": "Test automation teams often struggle with framework complexity, poor maintainability, and lack of standardization across projects. Many frameworks become technical debt, difficult to understand for new team members, and hard to scale as the application grows.",
      "solution": "Designed and built QASmartTestLab from the ground up with clean architecture principles, emphasizing separation of concerns, clear naming conventions, and comprehensive documentation. Implemented flexible runtime configuration allowing teams to switch browsers, environments, and execution modes without code changes. The Page Object Model pattern ensures easy maintenance, while tag-based filtering enables precise test execution control.",
